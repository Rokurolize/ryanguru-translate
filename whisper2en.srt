00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,640
Hello, this is Rengar.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:07,680
Today, I'm going to show you a simple practice method that will help you to reduce your luck in VALORANT.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,000
I've coached a lot of VALORANT C9 players in the past, and I've coached a lot of Radiant players.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,080
There are a lot of people who achieved Radiant after that.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,800
There are a lot of people who played Hearth's Grail.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,040
Overall, it's a proven method that a lot of VALORANT users have seen.

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,120
It will be helpful if you try it once for a warm-up.

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,800
First of all, you need to know the range where you can hold the spray and make a precise aim.

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,000
Don't just turn your wrist.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,800
Just relax your hand and move it gently.

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,120
It's going to be about this much.

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,240
It doesn't matter how you feel.

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,080
You have to move the mouse a little bit for detailed control anyway.

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,360
If the sensitivity is high, you can give it more power or narrow the range of motion.

15
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,640
It's kind of like this.

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,920
Of course, each person has a different range.

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,320
Don't worry about that.

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,560
If you feel like this is the range where you can make a precise aim, just check it out.

19
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,080
If it's hard, you can do it.

20
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,720
Don't hit this first.

21
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,240
Just practice.

22
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,280
First of all, make a reference point in the middle.

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,400
So, you're going to hit it here.

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,320
Hit it and come back.

25
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,400
Hit it and come back.

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,600
Hit it and come back.

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,560
Like this.

28
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,520
From the closest to the farthest.

29
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,000
Or you can do it from the farthest to the nearest.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,640
The point to be careful is to come this far and push it back.

31
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,800
Or you can go over and go back.

32
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,640
You can't do this.

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,760
Even if you push it over here, it's only this far when you get to the actual point.

34
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,960
It's the same for going over.

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,640
You just have to go at once as if you're connecting a dot and a dot.

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,880
It's better to feel like you're pushing the mouse rather than going with your wrist or arm.

37
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,160
Usually, there are a lot of people who practice pulling their wrists or arms diagonally.

38
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,720
That's one of the reasons for the ups and downs.

39
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,400
Because our wrists don't always turn this much.

40
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,120
If you aim, the range of the range changes.

41
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,160
So, the wrist that was originally hit like this.

42
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,240
At some point, it's only up to here.

43
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,240
The same goes for the arm.

44
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,640
Depending on the condition of the arm muscle, the result is different.

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,520
Depending on the conditions.

46
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,760
It's not a matter of whether it's right or wrong.

47
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,120
So, feel the mouse a little more and move it.

48
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,680
What you need to check at this point is that the range of my hand is alive as the aim touches it.

49
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,720
You have to check it.

50
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,440
So, check if it's moving as the aim touches it.

51
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,920
Check if it's moving as the aim touches it.

52
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,160
You know, the range where the precise aim is possible.

53
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,280
I'm checking if this is moving.

54
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,200
So, check if the range of my precise aim is alive as the aim touches it.

55
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,800
You can tap it and check it.

56
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,520
And then you can do it once while connecting the target and the target.

57
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,360
Check if it's moving while connecting the target and the target.

58
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,840
The reason why I'm doing this is that even if I recognize the enemy and move the aim correctly,

59
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,800
There's no guarantee that the enemy will stay still.

60
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,480
And the higher the tier, the higher the level of picking and step.

61
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,400
Even if the enemy moves and the aim doesn't reach you at once,

62
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,080
You need to be able to aim precisely here to grab the spray and push the aim.

63
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,440
So, if you're good at shooting, you'll see that even if the bullet is shining,

64
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,840
You've seen a lot of people pushing the aim like this.

65
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,360
You can adjust the aim while moving the target.

66
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,160
It's a little bit of a hand movement.

67
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,800
It's a little bit of a hand movement.

68
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,200
It's a little bit of a hand movement.

69
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,360
At first, you can do it easily or normally.

70
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,320
Move the aim and check if it's possible to aim precisely.

71
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,080
You can do it like this.

72
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,360
If you get used to it, you'll be able to move it fast.

73
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,480
I use things that drag my wrists or arms.

74
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,360
If you use that, you can get to the second and third tier.

75
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,920
If you just grab this, it's a highlight angle.

76
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,280
By the time you do it, you'll be able to shoot something like this and die.

77
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,200
I'm not good at precise aim.

78
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
I'm not good at precise aim.

79
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,640
There's a lot of these types of aim.

80
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,360
There's a lot of these types of aim.

81
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,040
Next time, I'll try to connect the target to the target.

82
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,120
Check your hands are moving.

83
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,000
Check.

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,960
I'll move it and check it one more time.

85
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,480
Then step on it and do it.

86
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,240
I'll do the same thing when I hit the robot.

87
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,840
Then, tactically, at the end.

88
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,040
It would be helpful if you tap and check it one by one.

89
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,640
It's not about the aim.

90
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,440
It's a practice that naturally keeps the aim performance.

91
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,080
If you apply this principle, you don't have to do anything about the practice.

92
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,640
It's okay to do a deathmatch.

93
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,920
In fact, I explained it a little bit, but I'm uploading videos about AIM, so please check them out.

94
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,880
If there are many people who want it, I'll talk about Kass Valorant AIM in more detail.

95
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,720
If there are many people, I'll stop here.

96
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,640
Thank you for watching.
