Hello, this is Rengar.

00:01.640 --> 00:07.680
Today, I'm going to show you a simple practice method that will help you to reduce your luck in VALORANT.

00:07.680 --> 00:14.000
I've coached a lot of VALORANT C9 players in the past, and I've coached a lot of Radiant players.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.080
There are a lot of people who achieved Radiant after that.

00:16.080 --> 00:17.800
There are a lot of people who played Hearth's Grail.

00:17.800 --> 00:23.040
Overall, it's a proven method that a lot of VALORANT users have seen.

00:23.040 --> 00:26.120
It will be helpful if you try it once for a warm-up.

00:26.120 --> 00:30.800
First of all, you need to know the range where you can hold the spray and make a precise aim.

00:30.800 --> 00:33.000
Don't just turn your wrist.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.800
Just relax your hand and move it gently.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.120
It's going to be about this much.

00:38.120 --> 00:39.240
It doesn't matter how you feel.

00:39.240 --> 00:43.080
You have to move the mouse a little bit for detailed control anyway.

00:43.080 --> 00:46.360
If the sensitivity is high, you can give it more power or narrow the range of motion.

00:46.360 --> 00:47.640
It's kind of like this.

00:47.640 --> 00:49.920
Of course, each person has a different range.

00:49.920 --> 00:51.320
Don't worry about that.

00:51.320 --> 00:55.560
If you feel like this is the range where you can make a precise aim, just check it out.

00:55.560 --> 00:56.080
If it's hard, you can do it.

00:56.080 --> 00:57.720
Don't hit this first.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.240
Just practice.

00:59.240 --> 01:02.280
First of all, make a reference point in the middle.

01:02.280 --> 01:04.400
So, you're going to hit it here.

01:04.400 --> 01:05.320
Hit it and come back.

01:05.320 --> 01:06.400
Hit it and come back.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.600
Hit it and come back.

01:07.600 --> 01:08.560
Like this.

01:08.560 --> 01:10.520
From the closest to the farthest.

01:10.520 --> 01:13.000
Or you can do it from the farthest to the nearest.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.640
The point to be careful is to come this far and push it back.

01:17.640 --> 01:19.800
Or you can go over and go back.

01:19.800 --> 01:20.640
You can't do this.

01:20.640 --> 01:24.760
Even if you push it over here, it's only this far when you get to the actual point.

01:24.760 --> 01:25.960
It's the same for going over.

01:26.080 --> 01:29.640
You just have to go at once as if you're connecting a dot and a dot.

01:29.640 --> 01:33.880
It's better to feel like you're pushing the mouse rather than going with your wrist or arm.

01:33.880 --> 01:38.160
Usually, there are a lot of people who practice pulling their wrists or arms diagonally.

01:38.160 --> 01:40.720
That's one of the reasons for the ups and downs.

01:40.720 --> 01:43.400
Because our wrists don't always turn this much.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.120
If you aim, the range of the range changes.

01:46.120 --> 01:48.160
So, the wrist that was originally hit like this.

01:48.160 --> 01:50.240
At some point, it's only up to here.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.240
The same goes for the arm.

01:51.240 --> 01:54.640
Depending on the condition of the arm muscle, the result is different.

01:54.640 --> 01:55.520
Depending on the conditions.

01:55.520 --> 01:56.760
It's not a matter of whether it's right or wrong.

01:56.760 --> 01:59.120
So, feel the mouse a little more and move it.

01:59.120 --> 02:03.680
What you need to check at this point is that the range of my hand is alive as the aim touches it.

02:03.680 --> 02:04.720
You have to check it.

02:04.720 --> 02:07.440
So, check if it's moving as the aim touches it.

02:07.440 --> 02:08.920
Check if it's moving as the aim touches it.

02:08.920 --> 02:11.160
You know, the range where the precise aim is possible.

02:11.160 --> 02:13.280
I'm checking if this is moving.

02:13.280 --> 02:17.200
So, check if the range of my precise aim is alive as the aim touches it.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.800
You can tap it and check it.

02:19.800 --> 02:22.520
And then you can do it once while connecting the target and the target.

02:22.520 --> 02:25.360
Check if it's moving while connecting the target and the target.

02:25.520 --> 02:29.840
The reason why I'm doing this is that even if I recognize the enemy and move the aim correctly,

02:29.840 --> 02:31.800
There's no guarantee that the enemy will stay still.

02:31.800 --> 02:35.480
And the higher the tier, the higher the level of picking and step.

02:35.480 --> 02:38.400
Even if the enemy moves and the aim doesn't reach you at once,

02:38.400 --> 02:43.080
You need to be able to aim precisely here to grab the spray and push the aim.

02:43.080 --> 02:46.440
So, if you're good at shooting, you'll see that even if the bullet is shining,

02:46.440 --> 02:49.840
You've seen a lot of people pushing the aim like this.

02:49.840 --> 02:52.360
You can adjust the aim while moving the target.

02:52.360 --> 02:54.160
It's a little bit of a hand movement.

02:54.160 --> 02:54.800
It's a little bit of a hand movement.

02:55.520 --> 02:56.200
It's a little bit of a hand movement.

02:56.200 --> 02:59.360
At first, you can do it easily or normally.

02:59.360 --> 03:03.320
Move the aim and check if it's possible to aim precisely.

03:03.320 --> 03:06.080
You can do it like this.

03:06.080 --> 03:09.360
If you get used to it, you'll be able to move it fast.

03:09.360 --> 03:12.480
I use things that drag my wrists or arms.

03:12.480 --> 03:16.360
If you use that, you can get to the second and third tier.

03:16.360 --> 03:17.920
If you just grab this, it's a highlight angle.

03:17.920 --> 03:21.280
By the time you do it, you'll be able to shoot something like this and die.

03:21.280 --> 03:22.200
I'm not good at precise aim.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.200
I'm not good at precise aim.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.640
There's a lot of these types of aim.

03:24.640 --> 03:25.360
There's a lot of these types of aim.

03:25.520 --> 03:27.040
Next time, I'll try to connect the target to the target.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.120
Check your hands are moving.

03:29.120 --> 03:30.000
Check.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.960
I'll move it and check it one more time.

03:32.960 --> 03:35.480
Then step on it and do it.

03:35.480 --> 03:37.240
I'll do the same thing when I hit the robot.

03:37.240 --> 03:38.840
Then, tactically, at the end.

03:38.840 --> 03:43.040
It would be helpful if you tap and check it one by one.

03:43.040 --> 03:44.640
It's not about the aim.

03:44.640 --> 03:49.440
It's a practice that naturally keeps the aim performance.

03:49.440 --> 03:53.080
If you apply this principle, you don't have to do anything about the practice.

03:53.080 --> 03:54.640
It's okay to do a deathmatch.

03:54.640 --> 03:59.920
In fact, I explained it a little bit, but I'm uploading videos about AIM, so please check them out.

03:59.920 --> 04:04.880
If there are many people who want it, I'll talk about Kass Valorant AIM in more detail.

04:04.880 --> 04:06.720
If there are many people, I'll stop here.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.640
Thank you for watching.
