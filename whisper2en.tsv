0	1640	Hello, this is Rengar.
1640	7680	Today, I'm going to show you a simple practice method that will help you to reduce your luck in VALORANT.
7680	14000	I've coached a lot of VALORANT C9 players in the past, and I've coached a lot of Radiant players.
14000	16080	There are a lot of people who achieved Radiant after that.
16080	17800	There are a lot of people who played Hearth's Grail.
17800	23040	Overall, it's a proven method that a lot of VALORANT users have seen.
23040	26120	It will be helpful if you try it once for a warm-up.
26120	30800	First of all, you need to know the range where you can hold the spray and make a precise aim.
30800	33000	Don't just turn your wrist.
33000	36800	Just relax your hand and move it gently.
36800	38120	It's going to be about this much.
38120	39240	It doesn't matter how you feel.
39240	43080	You have to move the mouse a little bit for detailed control anyway.
43080	46360	If the sensitivity is high, you can give it more power or narrow the range of motion.
46360	47640	It's kind of like this.
47640	49920	Of course, each person has a different range.
49920	51320	Don't worry about that.
51320	55560	If you feel like this is the range where you can make a precise aim, just check it out.
55560	56080	If it's hard, you can do it.
56080	57720	Don't hit this first.
57720	59240	Just practice.
59240	62280	First of all, make a reference point in the middle.
62280	64400	So, you're going to hit it here.
64400	65320	Hit it and come back.
65320	66400	Hit it and come back.
66400	67600	Hit it and come back.
67600	68560	Like this.
68560	70520	From the closest to the farthest.
70520	73000	Or you can do it from the farthest to the nearest.
73000	77640	The point to be careful is to come this far and push it back.
77640	79800	Or you can go over and go back.
79800	80640	You can't do this.
80640	84760	Even if you push it over here, it's only this far when you get to the actual point.
84760	85960	It's the same for going over.
86080	89640	You just have to go at once as if you're connecting a dot and a dot.
89640	93880	It's better to feel like you're pushing the mouse rather than going with your wrist or arm.
93880	98160	Usually, there are a lot of people who practice pulling their wrists or arms diagonally.
98160	100720	That's one of the reasons for the ups and downs.
100720	103400	Because our wrists don't always turn this much.
103400	106120	If you aim, the range of the range changes.
106120	108160	So, the wrist that was originally hit like this.
108160	110240	At some point, it's only up to here.
110240	111240	The same goes for the arm.
111240	114640	Depending on the condition of the arm muscle, the result is different.
114640	115520	Depending on the conditions.
115520	116760	It's not a matter of whether it's right or wrong.
116760	119120	So, feel the mouse a little more and move it.
119120	123680	What you need to check at this point is that the range of my hand is alive as the aim touches it.
123680	124720	You have to check it.
124720	127440	So, check if it's moving as the aim touches it.
127440	128920	Check if it's moving as the aim touches it.
128920	131160	You know, the range where the precise aim is possible.
131160	133280	I'm checking if this is moving.
133280	137200	So, check if the range of my precise aim is alive as the aim touches it.
137200	139800	You can tap it and check it.
139800	142520	And then you can do it once while connecting the target and the target.
142520	145360	Check if it's moving while connecting the target and the target.
145520	149840	The reason why I'm doing this is that even if I recognize the enemy and move the aim correctly,
149840	151800	There's no guarantee that the enemy will stay still.
151800	155480	And the higher the tier, the higher the level of picking and step.
155480	158400	Even if the enemy moves and the aim doesn't reach you at once,
158400	163080	You need to be able to aim precisely here to grab the spray and push the aim.
163080	166440	So, if you're good at shooting, you'll see that even if the bullet is shining,
166440	169840	You've seen a lot of people pushing the aim like this.
169840	172360	You can adjust the aim while moving the target.
172360	174160	It's a little bit of a hand movement.
174160	174800	It's a little bit of a hand movement.
175520	176200	It's a little bit of a hand movement.
176200	179360	At first, you can do it easily or normally.
179360	183320	Move the aim and check if it's possible to aim precisely.
183320	186080	You can do it like this.
186080	189360	If you get used to it, you'll be able to move it fast.
189360	192480	I use things that drag my wrists or arms.
192480	196360	If you use that, you can get to the second and third tier.
196360	197920	If you just grab this, it's a highlight angle.
197920	201280	By the time you do it, you'll be able to shoot something like this and die.
201280	202200	I'm not good at precise aim.
202200	203200	I'm not good at precise aim.
203200	204640	There's a lot of these types of aim.
204640	205360	There's a lot of these types of aim.
205520	207040	Next time, I'll try to connect the target to the target.
207040	209120	Check your hands are moving.
209120	210000	Check.
210000	212960	I'll move it and check it one more time.
212960	215480	Then step on it and do it.
215480	217240	I'll do the same thing when I hit the robot.
217240	218840	Then, tactically, at the end.
218840	223040	It would be helpful if you tap and check it one by one.
223040	224640	It's not about the aim.
224640	229440	It's a practice that naturally keeps the aim performance.
229440	233080	If you apply this principle, you don't have to do anything about the practice.
233080	234640	It's okay to do a deathmatch.
234640	239920	In fact, I explained it a little bit, but I'm uploading videos about AIM, so please check them out.
239920	244880	If there are many people who want it, I'll talk about Kass Valorant AIM in more detail.
244880	246720	If there are many people, I'll stop here.
264640	266640	Thank you for watching.
